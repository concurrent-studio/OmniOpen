# Contributing to the OmniOpen Initiative

## Adding a Project to the OmniOpen Certified List
To add a project to the [README](./README.md)'s OmniOpen Certified Projects list, please submit an issue under the tag `Certification`.

## Altering the OmniOpen Initiative's Language
To contribute to the OmniOpen Initiative itself, please either submit a pull request or email us at <null@concurren.studio>.
Contribution is casual and open as the project is quite simple in construction.
All ideas will be thoughtfully considered and thorough reasoning in support or denial of all suggestions will be given.
