This work stands on the shoulders of giants.
Much of the inspiration for this project comes from [Aaron Swartz](https://archive.org/details/GuerillaOpenAccessManifesto) and his heroic dedication to the democratization of knowledge.

## [OmniOpen Logo](./graphics/OmniOpen.min.svg)
The O2 logo was directly inspired by [Michele Spera](http://www.designculture.it/interview/michele-spera.html)'s and [Mimmo Castellano](http://www.museodelmarchioitaliano.com/route4/mimmo-castellano.php)'s 1972 Comitato Olimpico Nazionale Italiano [logo](http://www.logobook.com/logo/c-o-n-i-25/). The *2*'s in these logos are nearly identical.
